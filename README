Python Interface to Tesseract

PyTesseract creates a PythonType that uses TessBaseAPI to perform OCR on an
Image.  You can use any of the multitude of Python modules to open and convert
an image to a format that tesseract can read.

There is very little error checking, or getters and setters, but that can be
fixed in time.

= Installation =

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

import tesseract

t = tesseract.Tesseract(lang="eng")
